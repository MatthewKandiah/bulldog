Somehow I've never actually tried just building a simple site and server. Going to have a go at writing some really basic HTML/CSS/JS to make a really simple site. Writing the server in Rust with actix-web because I've played with it a little bit before. 

## Goals
- Have a landing page with some buttons, navigate you around on button presses
- Add some interactivity to a page - maybe a calculator? Chance to play with some old fashioned JS
- Make something with some persistent state - keep it super simple at first, maybe just write values to a csv or json file on the server. Just want to post and get updates on different clients
